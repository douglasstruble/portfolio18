                                <li>Being a gamer was often associated with socially awkward, introverted behavior. </li>

                    <p> From my survey data and a series of interviews with self-proclaimed “mobile gamers”, I gained a deeper insight into the social world of gaming and the elements behind a successful game. I also came upon Richard Bartle prevalent player categorization models that reflected precisely what I found in my research. You can read abou it here:

This meant that <a href=" https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dbqmirt3fX2eV1nSInx72DKBz4RiMhGe"target="_blank"> user objective </a> must be clear and that the user interface should be simple.

                    <p>The language of comedy has a violent vocabulary. You throw punch lines; you kill the audience, you bombed, slap stick, etc. The simple act of telling jokes is both fun and scary met with dramatic silence or visceral laughter.  For these reasons, the game’s look and feel is founded on the display iconography of boxing. The brutally simple, black, white together with blood red color scheme combined with bold, tall fonts are iconic propaganda style reveal how linked laughter and combat truly are. </p>

        <p>My first attempt at creating a low fidelity prototype focused primarily on the mechanics of game play. I thought a swiping gesture mimicked throwing a punch. I also saw how intuitively this gesture worked with content drawers and designing for small screens. As outlined in the on boarding tutorial the user begins at their inbox where a group chat is under way. Then the user follows the 3 steps to begin the game. </p>

                         <li>AIM<br>

 I conducted three user tests that were done over the phone and using live share in Invision. Every user read the tutorial but did not understand drawers or the UI in general. I did learn that the users considered the swipe gesture not so much of an actionable gesture but primarily used it for sorting or browsing content. Overall the users echoed my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YWA9jgXYqrFAHh0UGCbngF-pJ0xLoPPu" target="_blank">user objectives</a> precisily but this wasn't properly translated into a intuitive UI, so I went back to the drawing board.

                  <p>It became clear that no one really understood the swiping gesture, they all wanted to hit a button in the middle of the screen. The brawl of jokes in the inbox most users found overwhelming. So in this version it was all about a one on one boxing matches. I also learned that sorting, writing and searching jokes was of paramount importance to players and game strategy. From these insights, I fundamentally changed the format of by dividing the screen into two boxes, the jokes and user on top and the chat match and opponent on the bottom. You can also see in this version how my brand boxing research influenced the prototype. The users take corners, user punch the central button, the winner belt, the colors and icons, etc. </p>

                          <p> These screens are at the end of a new user on-boarding flow. To easily find an opponent the location finder must be allowed.

 From the feedback I received, I created a new prototype and then tested it in person with three new users.  I also sent the new link to my first group of user and asked for their feedback. The testing revealed a better overall UI patterns but highlighted how game play demanded a further streamlined search and sorting functionality.

                  <p>From my user testing, I learned that thumbs are the masters of the game universe. So I accommodated those thumb wars and turned the screen horizontal.  I also learned swiping is associated with browsing so in this version the user sorts and searches jokes by swiping. <br>
<br>
The duality of the split screen was way to confusing of users. So instead of reinventing the wheel, I adopted the standard UI patterns for chat apps and how users send a gifs or emoji.  <br>
<br>
My study of gamification techniques greatly influenced this prototype. A more prominent score, leader boards, 12 round matches and time limits that influence scoring. Incentivizing starting fight by giving a point advantage. Punishing user with a counter punch if they send jokes their opponent has already heard.  Overall, I focused on making the game fun and competitive without to many rules.

After posting on Slack, I had several discussions with developers. These conversations revealed that I could continue to gather quantitative data from my clickable prototype and extrapolate that into game strategy and play. But the quickest and easiest way to gather true qualitative research meant making a simple working prototype to test the functionality and strategies of actual game play. So this is what I have currently began to do.

                    <p> I love doing research and gaming is such a rich and evolving area for exploring.  Learning about gamification and the gamer psychology was fascinating. I also really enjoyed the passion of the "gamers" I interviewed and who tested my prototype. <br>
<br>
Translating the idea of the game into a clear user interface was challenging.  Done in solitude it felt like untangling a web. But with patience and applying the design thinking process (Empathize – Define – Ideate – Prototype - Test – Implement) I soon got a clear picture of the UI, and once I could see it, I could make it. 
Because my first profession was graphic design, my largest lesson was staying low fidelity for as long as possible. Design is a waist of time at the wire frame and lo fidelity level. Now I know!
<br>
<br>
User testing involves one of my favorite things, asking questions. And the insights from user testing were no less than revolutionary in clarifying user patterns and orienting the game. Through out this project, I have been amazed at the amount of enthusiasm Punch Line has inspired in others. After posting this project on Slack, I recieved lots of positive feed back and recently have been working with developers on building a working actionable game! I am very excited and look forward to sharing this once it is finished.
